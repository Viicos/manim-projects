# Manim projects

This repo stores the code I'm writing to produce my physics animated videos.

## Requirements

The code is rendered using the [ManimCommunity/manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/) library.

The code isn't consistently updated to work with the latest version of Manim, so things could break at a certain point.

## Structure

- [`anims.py`](anims.py)/[`anims2.py`](anims2.py): code produced in collaboration with a school teacher.
- [`opening.py`](opening.py): code produced for the [OpenING]([OpenING](https://www.polytech-reseau.org/opening/)) project.
- [`behindeq.py`](behindeq.py): pending Youtube video project.
